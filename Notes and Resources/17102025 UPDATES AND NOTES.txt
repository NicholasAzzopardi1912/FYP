17/10/2025 UPDATES AND NOTES
two separate DNNs for all 6 models, one training arousal and one for valence

rather than using 80/20 default split, 5 cross validation group 5 fold based on participants (participant number is treated as ID although dataset was published like so. between train/test

Now since k = 5, this will train the model 5 times iteratively

Like this we have individual people in the train set and individual people in the test set
group k-fold
group 5-fold
same thing just k = 5
FOR ALL MODELS ABOVE 


maybe look at developing a custom loss function - for teacher models in the next stage


ensure models are developed using tensorflow

output arousal or valence with the respective accuracy and classification reports produced for each

Consider reducing dropout from 0.3 to 0.1 since the baseline models only have a couple of layers
