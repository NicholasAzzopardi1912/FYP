dont try to improve anything for now


On the Trello board their is the following: UPDATE YOUR EVALUATION METRICS TO THE FOLLOWING:

For each fold save the following training and testing performance metrics:

Regression (baseline models + privileged information models)

Pearson’s correlation coefficient

Mean squared error

Classification (baseline models + privileged information models)

F1 score

Accuracy

Pearson’s correlation coefficient using the probabilistic outputs of the models

***********************************************************************************************

Where we currently at:
All 6 single modality models have been updated with the correct metrics and storing of metrics

Now got to update the metrics for the 3 stream regression teacher model and store them

Then get to work on the 3 stream classification teacher model

Then google spreadsheet to store and share results with him
