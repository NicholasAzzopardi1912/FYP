Accuracy

Pearson’s correlation coefficient using the probabilistic outputs of the models

***********************************************************************************************

Where we currently at:
All 6 single modality models have been updated with the correct metrics and storing of metrics

The metrics and storing for the 3 stream regression teacher model has been updated

The google spreadsheet has been created, populated, and shared

 The 3 stream classification teacher model is also complete and its results have been populated
