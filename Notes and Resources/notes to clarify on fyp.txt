notes to clarify on fyp

1) on the proj description is said that i shall be using AGAIN and their either recola or sewa. we agreed that we shall be focusing on only recola and alternating the modalaties but does that mean that AGAIN is also not going to be used

2) clarify about the 3 modalitites and 3 experiments in terms of the fact that if 2 are used as standard and once is used as privlidged info, then theirs 9 combinations of experiments technically rather than just 3 so clarify about that
